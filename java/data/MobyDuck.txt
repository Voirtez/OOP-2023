(1417) After fourteen years I left the sea, for a life upon a lake
(7292) After all the storms I'd seen, I needed a good break
(12417) I thought still waters would mean peace for me
(15750) But that was a mistake
(18263) For the place I chose was bedevilled by a giant, evil drake
(24320) A mallard of such malice, twice the size of any man
(27778) A bill to give you nightmares and a monsterous wingspan
(31237) You cannot hope to fight it, so avoid him if you can
(34820) That terrifying waterfoul, the beast beyond the dam
(38612) Row-ho, row-ho, row with all our might
(42153) Row with harpoons loaded and spoiling for a fight
(45612) Row-ho, row-ho, and with any luck
(48945) We'll win the day and do away the dreaded Moby Duck
(52570) I'm not one for surrender, so a vengeful oath I swore
(56278) I gathered up me hearties like so many times before
(59785) We shod our ship with weapons and prepared to go to war
(62838) 'Til the fetid, feathered, fearsome, flying duck will breathe no more
(66963) Row-ho, row-ho, row with all our might
(70505) Row with harpoons loaded and spoiling for a fight
(74130) Row-ho, row-ho and with any luck
(77540) We'll win the day and do away the dreaded Moby Duck
(80762) There was bonnie brave Marie, who to her arms had waved goodbye
(84596) And handsome Jack whose duck-attack left him without an eye
(88137) The Darby twins with one leg each on deck were standing by
(91429) Only a couple dozen limbs between a crew of twenty-five
(95410) Row-ho, row-ho, row with all our might
(98910) Row with harpoons loaded and spoiling for a fight
(102520) Row-ho, row-ho and with any luck
(105808) We'll win the day and do away the dreaded Moby Duck
(109434) The fight raged on for several hours, defend and then attack
(113893) With beatings from those wicked wings, our boat began to crack
(118675) The beast reared up to finish the job, and with a mighty quack...
(127063) "Quack"
(127839) I rammed my harpoon in his throat and made a tasty snack
(131738) Row-ho, row-ho, row us back to shore
(135244) We'll drag his broken body back and roast it on an oar
(138893) Row-ho, row-ho, barbecue the beast
(142333) With hoisin sauce and pancakes we will have the biggest feast
(145610) Oh, row-ho, row-ho, row with all our might
(149357) We rowed with harpoons loaded and spoiling for a fight
(153092) Row-ho, row-ho, row we had all the luck
(156533) We won the day and did away the dreaded Moby Duck
(160104) We won the day and did away the dreaded Moby Duck!
(163414) "Quack"
