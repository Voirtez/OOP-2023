(0:00) After fourteen years I left the sea, for a life upon a lake
(0:06) After all the storms I'd seen, I needed a good break
(0:11) I thought still waters would mean peace for me
(0:14) But that was a mistake
(0:17) For the place I chose was bedevilled by a giant, evil drake
(0:22) A mallard of such malice, twice the size of any man
(0:26) A bill to give you nightmares and a monsterous wingspan
(0:30) You cannot hope to fight it, so avoid him if you can
(0:33) That terrifying waterfoul, the beast beyond the dam
(0:37) Row-ho, row-ho, row with all our might
(0:40) Row with harpoons loaded and spoiling for a fight
(0:44) Row-ho, row-ho, and with any luck
(0:48) We'll win the day and do away the dreaded Moby Duck
(0:51) I'm not one for surrender, so a vengeful oath I swore
(0:55) I gathered up me hearties like so many times before
(0:58) We shod our ship with weapons and prepared to go to war
(1:01) 'Til the fetid, feathered, fearsome, flying duck will breathe no more
(1:05) Row-ho, row-ho, row with all our might
(1:09) Row with harpoons loaded and spoiling for a fight
(1:12) Row-ho, row-ho and with any luck
(1:16) We'll win the day and do away the dreaded Moby Duck
(1:19) There was bonnie brave Marie, who to her arms had waved goodbye
(1:23) And handsome Jack whose duck-attack left him without an eye
(1:27) The Darby twins with one leg each on deck were standing by
(1:30) Only a couple dozen limbs between a crew of twenty-five
(1:34) Row-ho, row-ho, row with all our might
(1:37) Row with harpoons loaded and spoiling for a fight
(1:41) Row-ho, row-ho and with any luck
(1:44) We'll win the day and do away the dreaded Moby Duck
(1:48) The fight raged on for several hours, defend and then attack
(1:52) With beatings from those wicked wings, our boat began to crack
(1:57) The beast reared up to finish the job, and with a mighty quack...
(2:05) "Quack"
(2:06) I rammed my harpoon in his throat and made a tasty snack
(2:10) Row-ho, row-ho, row us back to shore
(2:14) We'll drag his broken body back and roast it on an oar
(2:17) Row-ho, row-ho, barbecue the beast
(2:21) With hoisin sauce and pancakes we will have the biggest feast
(2:24) Oh, row-ho, row-ho, row with all our might
(2:28) We rowed with harpoons loaded and spoiling for a fight
(2:31) Row-ho, row-ho, row we had all the luck
(2:35) We won the day and did away the dreaded Moby Duck
(2:39) We won the day and did away the dreaded Moby Duck!
(2:42) "Quack"
